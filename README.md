# unExpired

Have you ever wondered how long your products last you? Are you still utilizing expired cosmetics and food on a regular basis? unExpired is a fantastic app that gives you power over your products by allowing you to track expiration dates so you never miss a date! Don't you agree that now is the time to start managing your food for a more effective and healthy lifestyle?

How does it work?

From the homepage of the app, fill in information about your product’s expiry date by clicking the plus button on the top right corner. This will include the name of the item and when you would like to be reminded of its expiry date.

The app will notify you when the date is approaching, so once the information is put in the app you don’t need to worry about it anymore! In the meantime, you can tap the lightbulb located in the navigation bar; the resources section will keep you educated on a wide range of topics.

Don’t believe it’s that easy? Test it yourself! The unExpired app also offers amazing features, such as light and dark modes and a wide selection of colours for you to choose from when listing your items.

Food, Cosmetics, Medication?! Don’t think unExpired is some one-trick pony. Use the app to track and get notified of anything that has an expiration date. All you have to do is sit patiently for that notification to appear.

unExpired, towards the path of never having expired products again.
